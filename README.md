## Default pet

BongoCat is the default pet.

## Requirements

- macOS 13 or later
- Git

The installer prepares everything else automatically.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yihanz0107/codex-deskpet-for-deepseek-harness.git
cd codex-deskpet-for-deepseek-harness
./install.sh
```

The installer finds DeepSeek Harness automatically and sets it up too when needed.

## Run

```bash
deepsshpet
```

This command starts both DeepSeek Harness and the desktop pet. If Harness is already running, it focuses the existing page instead of starting a duplicate service or opening another tab.

If an API Key has not been set yet, the first launch asks for one.

Open **DeepSeek Harness → Settings → Desktop Pet** to select pets, change size, edit quick phrases, show or hide the pet, and open the full-screen catalog.

## Pet Sources & Thanks

Special thanks to [ayangweb/bongocat](https://github.com/ayangweb/bongocat) and everyone who created and contributed to BongoCat. This project exists because I love the cat they made, and I wanted it to spend more time by my side—not only in its original application, but also while I use DeepSeek Harness. BongoCat is the default DeskPet and the starting point of this project.
